# What is this?

This is the C++ code that I wrote which I then translated to go. Currently I'm working on a compressor for ASH0, if you have any info as to how it works, please let me know!

**Note:** This code is not directly runnable as it does not have a main function. Feel free to put it in your own projects though, just attribute it properly if you redistribute. Thanks :smile:
