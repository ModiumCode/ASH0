ASH decompression in a golang program

# Notes

- This current implementation is temporary but will work great while a replacement is being made.
- I am currently working on writing a native go implementation.
- You don't need the AshUtils folder to run this example but you do need `AshUtils.exe`
- Source code was not meant to be compiled elsewhere and only on my machine (Windows using Visual Studio 2017) because this is a temporary solution. I only included the source because it was requested. If you can't figure out why it's not compiling for you, you probably don't know what you're doing.
- If you want to change the code around, do not leave out the comments that give credit to where it was translated from.
- If you have any questions feel free to ask me in the Pretendo discord (make sure to ping me Nybbit#5412)
