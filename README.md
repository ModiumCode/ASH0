ASH decompression written in native go

# Notes

- There's a lot of pointer arithmetic here, so if VSCode warns you about `Possible misuse of unsafe.Pointer`, just laugh it off
- The code in `test` is the exact code I wrote and isn't cleaned up and performs the check to verify if the decompression works
- The `main.go` in the root folder is a simplified/basic version without checks
- If you have any questions feel free to ask me in the Pretendo discord (make sure to ping me @Nybbit#5412)
